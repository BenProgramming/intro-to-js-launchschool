Will an error occur if you try to access an array element with an index
that is greater than or equal to the length of the array? 

For example: 

let foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
console.log(foo.length);  // => 3
console.log(foo[3]);      // will this result in an error?

Answer:
It will not throw an error, but will log 'undefined' to the console. 
The last index of arrays in JavaScript is equal to the length property 
minus one (or array.length - 1). Making foo[3]'s 3 index outside of the 
index range for the array.
