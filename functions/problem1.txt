What does this code log to the console? Does executing the foo function affect the output? Why or why not?

let bar = 1;
function foo() {
  let bar = 2;
}

foo();
console.log(bar); 


No, because the second definition of bar is within the function scope, outside of re-defining bar. However, if the let keyword was not used the variable would be redefined with the value of '2'.
