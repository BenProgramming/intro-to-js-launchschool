What happens when you run the following code? Why? 

const NAME = 'Victor';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);

NAME = 'Joe';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);

The program will print the greetings to the console for Victor, then there will be a type error when trying to assign a value to the const defined variable NAME on line 6. The const keyword is used to define a variable with a value that will not change (const <-> constant).
