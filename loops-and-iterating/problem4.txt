Does the following code produce an error? Why or why not? What output does this code send to the console? 

for (let i = 0; i < 5;) {
  console.log(i += 1);
}

// It will not produce an error, the interator selection in the for loop is optional. The console.log assignment of i will update it's value, and log the following 

1
