What does the following program log to the console? Why?

let foo = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
};

let qux = 'hello';

function bar(argument1, argument2) {
  argument1.a = 'hi';
  argument2 = 'hi';
}

bar(foo, qux);

console.log(foo.a);
console.log(qux); 

// "hi"
// "hello" 
// Primitives are not mutable so the qux value (which is referring to the primitive 'hello')  will remain 'hello' even though the parameter value passed is reassigned to 'hi'. Objects in JavaScript are mutable and are passed by reference to functions, this is the reason why the key value of the object is changed and utimately logged to the console.
