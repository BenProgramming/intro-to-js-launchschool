// Consider this code: 
> let x = "5"
> x = x + 1
= "51" 

// Now, consider this code: 
> let y = "5"
> y++ 

// What gets returned by y++ in the second snippet, and why? 

// When using the postfix increment operator, the addition is after the return.
// Therefore 5 (the number) will be returned. After the incrementation y will be equal to 6 because the number type of the increment will coerce the string to a number.
